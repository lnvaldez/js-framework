# JS Framework Project

[Technical Documentation](https://github.com/lnvaldez/js-framework/blob/main/docs/documentation.md)

## Overview

Lightweight JavaScript framework designed to be easily integrated into any project. It provides a simple component-based architecture and a virtual DOM for efficient rendering.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lnvaldez/js-framework.git
   cd js-framework-project
```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### Development

To start the development server, run:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start a local server using Vite, allowing you to see changes in real-time as you develop.

### Building for Production

To build the project using Babel, run:

```
npm run build:babel
```

This will transpile the source code in the src directory and output it to the dist directory.
